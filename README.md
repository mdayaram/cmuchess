CMU Chess Club
=========

Website for the CMU Chess Club back when I had first joined it (2007).

They've currently moved on to a new design and webmaster (how dare they!).  You can find their latest site here:

https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/org/cmu-chess-club/

But for nostalgic reasons, I saved all the source of my version and decided to host it on my own space:
