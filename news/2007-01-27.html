UC Fridays, Advertising, and Relocating?
</h3>

As most of you guys know (that may or may not be an assumption), the Chess Club has scheduled <b>February 16</b> for UC Fridays.  There will be a small tournament set up for your enjoyment.  If you'd like to learn more about the tournament or would like to sign up for it, go to the <a href="/tournaments.html">tournaments</a> page.  You can also take this opportunity to try out your chess skills in non-competative quick games with one of our members.  Don't forget to inquire about the club if you're a novice and what it can do for you; believe me, there is LOTS we can do for you ;).  Anyways, remember to stop by, even if it's just to say hi, everyone is welcome!

In other news, as you can see in our news, we have a new officer position:  Advertising Coodinator.  Filling in that wonderous position is Daniel Gordon.  He'll be helping us out with with our advertising issues, hopefully getting more of you guys coming to either the meetings or...well, here.  So if you're arriving from an advertisement from Gordon, Welcome to the Chess Club Website!  Hope you bookmarked us!
<br><br>
Finally, next week's meetings are going to be in the UC.  <i>Tuesday's</i> meeting will be in the <b>Pake Room</b> upstairs in the Skibo corridor, and <i>Wednesday's</i> will be in the <b>1987 Room</b> in the same corridor.  All meetings will now be held somewhere in the UC.  Unfortunately, rooms in the UC are hard to book consistently, it's a pretty popular place, so each week the meetings will probably be held in a different location.  How can you find out where the next meeting will be held?  Why, by coming here, of course.  Just take a look at the bottom-right corner of your screen for this week's meetings and locations.  Alternately, you could go to the <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a> page and look up the info in advance.  Anyways, that's it for today, I'll see you guys at the meetings!
