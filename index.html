Student Faculty Mixer!
</h3>
There's gonna be a student-faculty mixer this tuesday together with the math club.  Alas, not much information is known about this as of now, but I promise to keep things updated!  I believe that a regular chess meeting will be held however in the UC Caffee, so if all you want to do is just sit down and play a game of chess, just come on down to the Caffee.
